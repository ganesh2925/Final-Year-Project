<b>Mapbox</b> is an incredibly powerful tool for creating any map based applications, but it can be pretty daunting to get started with. This Project fetches Data from the Mapbox and displays a Realtime World Map with the features similar to Google Maps. It also uses the browser's <b>geolocation API as well as Mapbox plugins</b>.
